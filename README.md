# Weather App

A web-app built using Node.js that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch and display the weather of any city entered by the user.

## Features:
- Shows the temperature of the city along with a short description and an icon describing the weather.
- Weather is fetched without page reload using JavaScript.

## Planned Enhancements:
- [ ] Give the user suggestions for city names as he types.
- [ ] If there is no exact match for the user's entered city, show weather of 5-6 cities with matching spellings.
- [ ] Have an explore button to show weather of a random city.
- [ ] Show more information about the city like distance from user (using geolocation), capital, tourism etc and links to Wikipedia, Wikivoyage etc.
